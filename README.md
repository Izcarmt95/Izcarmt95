## Izcar Muñoz Torrez
I'm a Software Engineer 🧑🏻‍💻   
I'm currently learning about architecture, administration and devOps on AWS cloud.  
I have one AWS certification, this is  [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/9f623971-e33b-45a3-83b5-1eddc34ac4f4/linked_in_profile).  
I'm preparing for the next certification which is AWS SysOps Administrator.
